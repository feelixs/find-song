**More info**

By default, find-song samples 10 seconds of the provided audio, and starts at the beginning of it.

You can give a timestamp if you want him to search at a specific point in the video, and also make him sample a larger portion of it if needed.

It's also possible to directly supply find-song a link to sample - doing so will override the submission link:

This also works when replying to comments with links:
